DISCLAIMER: if you want to write games in Scala, don't use this :)

Reason one: I'm not a game programmer
Reason two: I'll probably never finish this

Background: I dabbled in games a looong time ago (think DeSmet C86 as your 
toolchain). Wanting to go back, I did some digging and found, among others, 
JGame (http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/). 

JGame is pretty nice - it's very easy to whip up a quick game. However, with
all due respect to its developer, I don't like the design of the code. 

I also don't really like Java. 

1+1 = 2, so I'm now porting JGame to Scala under the moniker 'sgame'. As my projects
usually do, it probably won't go anywhere, but you can't blame me for trying, can you?

(Oh - I also am a Scala n00b. So you are free to critique both my lack of game 
coding knowledge *and* my ignorance of proper Scala idioms. Have fun!)

I've applied Boris' license, because I'm stealing his code, after all...
